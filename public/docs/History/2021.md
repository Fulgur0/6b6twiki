# 2021

The server's map was reset for the last time when it was backdoored and ratted by [254n_m](../Players/254n_m.md) (owner of [L2X9](../MC%20Servers/L2X9.md)) with a backdoored version of [L2X9Core](https://github.com/254nm/L2X9Core) which patched many exploits. Leee had to reset the server machine (world files were kept on a separate hard drive). During this reset the save got corrupted. This map was later used when the server relaunched as `7b7t.me` and is still the same map that is being used today on 8b8t.
