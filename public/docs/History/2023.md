# 2023

In 2023 6b6t rose to its peak with an average player count of 90, sometimes even 100+.<br/>
There were alot of dupes found and automated by IKEA, which started with the IKEAv1 dupe that released upon IKEA's launch with their most powerful dupe from May 10th to the end of April called IKEAv5.<br/>
During this time there were a lot of private exploits:<br/>
- Coordinate exploit discovered and used by c1yd3i and TNT_jesse, which involved other player entities being loaded in no matter where the player was<br/>
- Godmode exploit discovered by Poutselas and vined_, involving donkeys in boats<br/>
- Teleport exploit discovered and used by Poutselas, vined_, c1yd3i and hokindo9000. After this exploit got patched vined_ and hokindo9000 found 2 other bypasses until the server switched software from MultiPaper to Folia<br/><br/>

As the year progressed the player count kept getting better, with June as the absolute peak.<br/>
After the summer holidays it kept getting worse for 6b.
However [qbasty](../Players/qbasty.md) kept the server alive by hosting the occasional events with the most notable being the Christmas quests in December.
