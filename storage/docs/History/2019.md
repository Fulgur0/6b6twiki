# 2019

`6b6t` was born in March of this year. During its early stages, it had a small player base ranging from 5-20 players and would sometimes get over 30 players. The server was premium only.

During this time, Leee, 0b0t's players and staff had much conflict, such as `0b0t` players joining `6b6t` to crash, lag or bot the server. This conflict would go on until June of [2020](./2020.md). `6b6t` was a premium server until Leee launched a cracked server sometime in late `2019` under the subdomain `cracked.6b6t.org` which did not get many players.

The map was also reset multiple times over the course of this year because of many reasons, some of them are unknown.
Reasons:
* Late 2019
  * The server machine lost power which caused all region files to corrupt.
  * All of the files lost to a hard drive failure, no backups were taken.
* November:
  * Something caused the map to corrupt
