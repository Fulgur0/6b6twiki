# 2020

During this year the COVID-19 pandemic started. In April-May the premium server was shut down, only the cracked server remained online.

Then, YouTuber [MrCramYT](https://www.youtube.com/@MrCramYT) livestreamed on the server which gained about 60 players. He later uploaded a now deleted video about it in June. This then motivated Leee to continue working on the cracked server and shut down the premium server after a hard drive failure.

During the summer and winter of this year the server gained alot of players.

In December the 6b6t.org domain was sold to a player called `Bleepo` which later split off from Leee because of some drama. Bleepo then created a new server with a completely different map but with the 6b6t.org domain name attached to it. Leee had to buy a new domain called 6b6t.co. The 6b6t.org domain was then sold to [qbasty](../Players/qbasty.md).
