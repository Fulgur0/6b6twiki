* Founding Story: (optional)
> The Hive branched of off another group called Pyromaniac Fireflies. It started with a Pyromaniac Fireflies base called "The Hive" or also considered as Hive 1. But somehow the base got griefed quickly. So Lerpietong and Byrobuff and some other members of Hive 1 joined forced to form the "The Hive" group. They did this cause they were fed up with the other owners of Pyromaniac Fireflies. They later made [Hive 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFIcEpTGAiU) and Hive Halloween
